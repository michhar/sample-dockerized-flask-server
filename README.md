simple_server
==============================

A simple flask server built with Docker, run with a `gunicorn` command as a container and tested with `curl`.

Prerequisites
---

* Docker
* curl command
* Python 3

Instructions
---

To build and test image and container:

1.  `docker build -t flask-sample-one:latest .`
2.  `docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 flask-sample-one`
3.  `curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST http://localhost:8080`

To stop and restart:

1.  `docker stop <container id>`
2.  `docker rm <container id>`

Troubleshooting
---

* You may need to restart Docker in order to run the curl command - (`systemctl restart docker` in unix environments; in the app in Windows) - otherwise may get:  `docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint`...
